    "# Project Report\n",
    "The project is open-ended with the exact goal to be decided amongst your group but the theme is around simulations and data relating to the coronavirus epidemic. You should make a program or several programs that can either run simulations or produce plots based on real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with your code there should be a group Project Report explaining your code and what it does and including some figures that are output from your code or perhaps links to videos or any other output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The report should not be long. The purpose of the report is to succinctly explain any models you are using or data that you have obtained and to show the resulting plots that you have made. This project is about code (rather than modelling, data analysis, or epidemiology) so the report should be about showcasing some outputs of your code and explaining how your code can be used to produce those as well as other outputs. A minimum of explanation is needed for those outputs to be understandable but you do not need to have a \"background\" section or a \"literature review\" or anything like that - It would be reasonable to include links to any references though e.g. if your models are inspired by something else."

    "On NDlib, there are 12 Epidemic models, of which 6 are Epidemic and 6 Opinion Dynamic:\n",

    "These Opinion Dynamics models are interesting and help the study of how opinions form in a population, however this is outside the scope of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation inputs\n",
    "All models share inputs of total nodes to run the simulation on, the fraction initially infected, and time the simulation is ran for. Based on the strain a user chooses, the percentage chance for infection and removal is obtained from [online data](https://www.dam.brown.edu/drp/talks/JosephSheely.pdf). In the absence of containing strategies, the infection is characterized by a high infection rate (we take α=0.9) and a low removal rate (γ=0.025 or 0.05).

    "\n",
    "We quickly realised that it was not feasible to create a graph with the actual values of population. Even 100,000 (1/5th of Bristol's population causes the program to freeze). Consequently, the population size is reduced and this factor of reduction is stored when later outputting statistics of model outputs."
