		APIs for population, age, etc.
		
2. From that data, run a variety of simulations
	SIR
	Vaccines, making people immune for a short time. Initial vaccine percentage
	Social distancing
	SIR+ (so people go from Removed (recovered) to susceptible again), 

    Opinion dynamics - 
	
3. Output
	Webpage? Video?

4. Compare with actual data!
    We compare the different


# RoadMap
1. Simple SIR Model, comparing bristol's infections with an SIR model.
2. Make that work for all of South England!
3. Introduce vaccination model, for each place  
	-https://www.healthdata.org/covid/covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-summary 
	this gives us the probabillity of it stopping the Covid variant use this and we
