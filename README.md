# Computer Programming Coursework 2021

The objective of the assignment is to submit an interactive Python program that allows the user to:

* Input a message to be encrypted/decrypted using a Caesar cipher.
* Specify the rotation used by the Caesar cipher.
* Automate the identification of the rotation needed to decipher an encrypted message.
* Extract statistics about the messages, such as letter frequency, maximum word length, etc.



The Python program must also be accompanied by a short, 1-2 page report, submitted as a .pdf file called report.pdf. This should discuss your implementation and any design choices. Your report should contain the following sections:

* Introduction: An overview/summary of what your program does to show that you have attempted to implement all the required components.
* Analysis: Discuss what programming techniques you chose to meet the objectives of the assignment and discuss why you made these decisions. For example, why you chose to use a specific data structure or how you improved the re-usability of your code.
* Conclusion: Discuss anything in your program that you think could be improved. If possible, make suggestions for what you could try to do to improve it if you had more time.
