# Undergrad-Coursework
This is just an archive repo so I can refer back to my old coursework projects. This isn't really to 'show off' - nothing about a first year's programming coursework is that impressive - but rather to continually exercise my git abilities. 

### First Year
1. EMAT10006

    **Brief:** An interactive python script able to encrypt and decrypt ASCII files and text with a Caesar Cipher, as well as containing a bruteforce decryptor and statistics module ran on decrypted messages.
  
    Considering implementing the program's functions weren't too difficult, I decided to focus on stricly structuring the project so that each function had its own module with subfunctions, called by the main.py script.

2. EMAT10007

    **Brief:** This was a group project aiming to familiarise us with working collaboratively with git as well as using Python for simulations and plotting. The brief was open-ended with the theme being around simulations and data relating to the coronavirus epidemic.
    
    From this, we made an interactive program which ran various simulations based on inputted data using a backend module containing the simulation functions. Simulations available were built on the back of [NDLib](https://ndlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and included Static SEIR, Dynamic SIR, as well as a custom model accounting for vaccinations.
    
    The backend module returned the data from the simulation, which was then plotted by the main script. Essentially, the main script acted as a sort of 'showcase', gathering interactively the parameters for the simulation which it then passed to the backend module to process.
    
    ### Second Year
    TBD!
